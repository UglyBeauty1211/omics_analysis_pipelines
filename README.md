# Omics Analysis Pipelines

A comprehensive collection of reproducible and well-documented pipelines for multi-omics biological data analysis.

## Overview

This repository provides a structured catalog of bioinformatics analysis pipelines covering various omics technologies and integrated multi-omics approaches. Each pipeline includes detailed documentation, tool recommendations, best practices, and workflow descriptions.

## 📚 Catalog

Explore our comprehensive **[Biological Multi-Omics Analysis Catalog](CATALOG.md)** organized by data type:

- **[Genomics](catalog/genomics/)** - Variant calling, structural variation, genome assembly
- **[Transcriptomics](catalog/transcriptomics/)** - RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, alternative splicing
- **[Proteomics](catalog/proteomics/)** - Mass spectrometry, PTM analysis, protein quantification
- **[Metabolomics](catalog/metabolomics/)** - Metabolite profiling, lipidomics, fluxomics
- **[Epigenomics](catalog/epigenomics/)** - DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, chromatin accessibility
- **[Metagenomics](catalog/metagenomics/)** - Microbiome analysis, taxonomic profiling, MAGs
